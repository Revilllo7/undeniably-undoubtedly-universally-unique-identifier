# undeniably-undoubtedly-universally-unique-identifier
let your anxiety take over and use UUUUID (undeniably undoubtedly universally unique identifier) an algorithm that uses a globally accessible database of all the UUUUIDs ever created and has a system that when you create a new UUUUID the system checks if a UUUUID already exists before creating it, recursively to make sure that it is 100% certain!

---

Currently in the works!
I add a new commit every time someone gets a matching UUID.
IF you want to expadate the UUUUID development, spam UUIDs till you get a match.
If you get a match. No need to document it. I *will* know.
